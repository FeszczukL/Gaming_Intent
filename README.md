# Project Name

## Overview

 The primary goal of the project is to set up and utilize machine learning models for text classification. The aim is to detect gaming-related intent in user inputs, which can help identify users' interests in gaming. It utilizes BERT for text classification, fine-tuned to [state your specific use case]. This project aims to [mention the goal or problem it solves, e.g., detect gaming-related intent in user inputs, automate text categorization, etc.].

This repository contains scripts for preprocessing data, training models, and performing inference on large datasets. It is built using **Hugging Face Transformers**, **PyTorch**, and **Python**.

## Installation

### Requirements

Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` package manager
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name

2.Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Checkpoints

Trained models and tokenizers are saved in the `./results` directory by default, but you can customize the output directory in the `TrainingArguments`.
